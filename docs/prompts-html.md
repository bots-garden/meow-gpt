I need an html form to type data about a person with:
- first name

I need to post the data to a Rest API.

I need an html grid to display all these persons.
the data comes from a REST API returning a json array of the list of the persons like this: [{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe"}] (of course there are more than one record)

can you generate the html page for that and the javascript code to fetch the data and populate the grid?
